# hotrod
CTF Swiss Army Knife.
HOTROD is a comprehensive, terminal-based utility script designed for Capture The Flag (CTF) players and cybersecurity enthusiasts. It combines common tasks such as encoding, hashing, encryption, forensics, and network analysis into a single, easy-to-use menu interface.

## usage
* Run the script directly, make sure its executable: `sudo chmod +x hotrod.sh`.
```bash
./hotrod.sh
```
* Use the latest updated version of this tool.
* Add the script to the bin folder to make it a command.
```bash
sudo mv hotrod.sh /usr/local/bin/hotrod
```

## all features
- **Encoding/Decoding:** Base64, Hex, and other formats
- **Hashing:** Generate hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, etc.)
- **Encryption:** Simple encryption/decryption helpers
- **Forensics:** Tools for analyzing files and extracting metadata
- **Analysis:** General utilities for inspecting data
- **Network:** Basic networking utilities

## Features

### 1. Encoding & Ciphers
* Base64 Encode/Decode
* Base32 Encode/Decode
* Hex Encode/Decode
* Binary Encode/Decode (010101 format)
* URL Decode

### 2. Hashing Utilities
* Calculate MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashes simultaneously.
* Integrity Check: Verify a file against a known hash string.

### 3. Encryption (AES/GPG)
* AES-256 Encryption/Decryption (using OpenSSL).
* GPG Encryption/Decryption.

### 4. File Forensics
* Identify file types using magic bytes.
* Extract readable strings from binary files.
* Extract Exif metadata (requires exiftool).
* Analyze firmware and file structures using Binwalk.

### 5. Cryptanalysis
* Identify hash and encoding types based on format and length.
* Brute-Force: Rotational ciphers (Caesar/ROT 1-26).
* Brute-Force: Dictionary attacks on MD5/SHA1 hashes using a wordlist.

### 6. Network & Shells
* Netcat Listener generator.
* Reverse Shell generator (Bash TCP).
* Local Interface IP display.
* Public IP fetcher.
* Simple TCP Port Scanner.

### 7. Interface
* Smart Input: Accepts file paths or direct text input.
* Auto-organized output: All results are saved to the "ctf_output" directory.

## Requirements

The script relies on standard Linux utilities. For full functionality, ensure the following are installed:
* bash
* python3
* openssl
* gpg
* binwalk
* exiftool (optional, for metadata extraction)
* xxd (usually part of vim-common)
